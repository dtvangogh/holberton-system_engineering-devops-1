You must add
* 3 firewalls
	* for security
* 1 SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS
	* to enable https
* 3 monitoring clients (data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services)
	* to mointor the data, depends on what is being monitored, monitor could be for web server
		or application

You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
* For every additional element, why you are adding it
	* answered above
* What are firewalls for
	* security purposes to avoid breaches
* Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
	* so that it's encrypted the entire time
* What monitoring is used for
	* getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected
* How the monitoring tool is collecting data
	* many ways, usually for hardware monitoring it keeps track of things like CPU usage, memoory, 
		disk, and network overloa
	* as an example NewRelic monitoring tool uses javascript that collects info and sends 
		it to their servers
* Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS
	* for qps for example, the monitor would track how much the servers query the database

You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
* Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
	* all traffic is unencrypted between load balancer and servers, if the balancer is off-site
		that presents obvious problems
* Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
	* the master/primary database structure can introduce an additional single point of failure
	* depending on the website and how much writing must be done it may bottleneck around that
* Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem
	* it duplicates architecture without regard for use case, for instance you might only need more 
		web servers to handle the requests, but not any more application server 
		computer power, so you;re adding whole additional servers when you only need 
		more of individual parts
