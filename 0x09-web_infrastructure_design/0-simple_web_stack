Web Infrastructure Design
1: lamp diagram: 
Linux: the os
Apache: web server
Mysql: database management
Php(or python): for back end of it


Must include 
You must use:
* 1 server
* 1 web server (Nginx)
   * Instead of apache
* 1 application server
* 1 application files (your code base)
* 1 database (MySQL)
* 1 domain name foobar.com configured with a www record that points to your server IP 8.8.8.8
Explain
You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
* What is a server
   * A piece of hardware or software that provides functionality to clients.  client server model.  Provide various functionality like sharing data or performing computation for a client.   A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers.
   * A web server is a software that delivers web pages. A server is an actual computer.
* What is the role of the domain name
   * Domain names serve to identify Internet resources, such as computers, networks, and services, with a text-based label that is easier to memorize than the numerical addresses used in the Internet protocols. 
* What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com
   * The use of www.example.com gives you the opportunity to use a CNAME for www that points to your CDN, while leaving the required NS and SOA records on example.com. The example.com record will usually also have an A record to point to a host that will redirect to www.example.com using an HTTP redirect.
* What is the role of the web server
   * A web server is a software that delivers web pages. A server is an actual computer.
   * Server soft or hardware that satisfies client requests on the world wide web
   * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server
* What is the role of the application server
   * Just a server specifically designed to run applications such as webapps, data processing, software distribution.
* What is the role of the database
   * Holds all permanent data about the website, to be more specific depends on the site, twitter holds users tweets etc, our airbnb had a database to hold many things like reviews users, locations etc.
* What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website
   * Depends which server: the web server uses TCP/IP.
Issues
* You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
   * SPOF: Single point of failure
   * Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)
   * Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic
